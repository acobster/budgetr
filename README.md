## Deploying to Heroku

Make sure you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed, then simply follow the steps below.

Optionally, test that your application runs locally with foreman by running.

```
foreman start
```

Now, you can initialize your git repo and commit your application.

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "init"
```
create your app on Heroku

```
heroku create
```

optionally, create a database for the application

```
heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql
```

The connection settings can be found at your [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/) under the add-ons for the app.

deploy the application

```
git push heroku master
```

Your application should now be deployed to Heroku!
